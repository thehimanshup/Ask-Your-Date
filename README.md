# Ask for a Date to Crush to go out

## Description
This is a playful and interactive website designed to ask your crush out on a date. The website presents two buttons, 'Yes' and 'No,' and adds a twist to make it more interesting. If your crush attempts to press the 'No' button, the button's location randomly changes to make it a bit challenging.

## Live Demo
Check out the live demo [here](https://thehimanshup.github.io/Ask-Your-Date/Yes.html/).

## How it Works
- If your crush clicks the 'Yes' button, the website acknowledges the positive response and also plays a funny song.
- If your crush tries to click the 'No' button, the button's location will unpredictably change, adding a fun element to the interaction.

## Usage

2. Click the 'Yes' button to express interest.
3. Try clicking the 'No' button and enjoy the surprise!
