# Ask for a Date to Crush to go out

## Description
This is a playful and interactive website designed to ask your crush out on a date. The website presents two buttons, 'Yes' and 'No,' and adds a twist to make it more interesting. If your crush attempts to press the 'No' button, the button's location randomly changes to make it a bit challenging.

## Live Demo
